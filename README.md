# Guardian Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). An express server is located in the `server` directory.

## Running the application

1. Clone the project and install required packages.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ryGutierrez/guardian-frontend.git
    cd guardian-frontend
    npm install
    ```

2. Within the project directory, run the two following commands:

    ### `npm run client`
    Stars the React application without the server.

    ### `npm run server`
    Starts the server without the React application.
